### [KunligiConnect](https://github.com/KunligiOnline/kunligiconnect)
About: **KunligiConnect** is a realtime chat application designed to facilitate connection between strangers through vulnerable and challenging conversations. KunligiConnect was designed for [Kunligi](https://www.kunligi.com/), a NY based organization that facilitates connection-building conversations through in-person gatherings. When the pandemic began, Kunligi could no longer host these gatherings, so KunligiConnect was created to translate the model pioneered by Kunligi into the digital space.
